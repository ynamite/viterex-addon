# Changelog

## **Version 3.2.5**

### Fixed

- **`Server::isProductionDeployment()` and `Server::isStagingDeployment()` no longer fatal without `ydeploy`** (`lib/Server.php`). Both methods called `rex_ydeploy::factory()` directly with no class-availability guard, so any project that installed `viterex_addon` without `ydeploy` got `Class "rex_ydeploy" not found` on the first call. The most visible victim was the backend dev-badge gate at `boot.php:113` (every backend page load with a logged-in user), but the same crash also fired from `Server::__construct → checkDebugMode()` — meaning every `Server::factory()` call from `OutputFilter`, `Preload`, `Assets`, and `Badge::get()` was affected. Both methods now early-return `false` when `rex_addon::get('ydeploy')->isAvailable()` is false, matching the behavior already documented in `CLAUDE.md` and the convention used at `boot.php:97` (`YREWRITE_SEO_TAGS` registration). With the guard pushed to the source, the call site at `boot.php:113` no longer needs its own ydeploy check, and future callers don't have to know about the dependency. `getDeploymentStage()` continues to fall through to `'dev'` when neither flag is true — unchanged behavior, now actually reachable on ydeploy-less installs.

## **Version 3.2.4**

### Fixed

- **Static assets attached to a CSS entry are now preloaded** (`lib/Preload.php`). When Vite emits an entry like `src/assets/css/style.css` whose manifest record has an `assets: [...]` siblings array (e.g. `@font-face` woff2 fonts referenced from CSS, or images referenced via `url()`), `Preload::walkManifestEntry` was returning early on any `.css`-extension entry — silently dropping every sibling preload tag. The early-return is meant to skip emitting a `modulepreload` for the CSS file itself (the stylesheet link is rendered by `Assets::renderBlock`), not to skip the asset loop further down. The CSS guard now scopes only the JS-only emissions (`modulepreload`, `entry.css`, `imports`/`dynamicImports` recursion); `entry.assets` runs for both CSS and JS entries and emits the appropriate `<link rel="preload" as="font|image|video|audio" …>` tags. Cross-entry dedup is preserved by the existing `array_unique` in `build()`. The bug only surfaced when a project shipped a standalone CSS entry whose `assets` siblings should be preloaded — JS entries that import CSS were unaffected because their fonts already surfaced via the JS chunk's own `assets` field.

### Internal

- **PreloadTest** (`tests/PreloadTest.php`) covers the regression plus six adjacent paths: JS modulepreload + `imports` walking, JS `css` siblings as `as=style` preload, image asset on a CSS entry, JS-entry imported asset, cross-entry dedup, and unknown-extension omission. To keep tests bootstrap-free (mirrors `OutputFilterTest`), `Preload` now exposes an `@internal` static seam `Preload::buildLinesForManifest(manifest, buildUrlPath, entries)` that the instance `build()` delegates to. Public API and behavior at all call sites (`Assets::renderBlock`, the `VITEREX_PRELOAD` extension point) are unchanged.

## **Version 3.2.3**

### Fixed

- **`viterex_addon.zip` no longer leaks into the MyREDAXO package.** The publish workflow created a `viterex_addon.zip` for the GitHub release upload, but `FriendsOfREDAXO/installer-action@1.2.0` then built its own MyREDAXO package by zipping the entire working directory (`archive.glob('**', { cwd, skip/ignore: installer_ignore + redaxo defaults })`). Redaxo's default ignore list does not include `*.zip`, so the GitHub-release zip was getting bundled into the MyREDAXO upload — a self-referential nested archive that ended up inside every install. Added `viterex_addon.zip` to `package.yml`'s `installer_ignore` list so the action's globber skips it. The GitHub-release artifact (which already used `-x "viterex_addon.zip"` in its own `zip` command) was always clean — only the MyREDAXO package was affected.

## **Version 3.2.2**

### Fixed

- **Dev badge no longer overflows on mobile.** The git-branch panel inside the badge could push the total width past narrow viewports — particularly with long branch names like `feature/<descriptive-slug>`. The `.branch` panel is now `display: none` below `max-width: 768px` (`assets-src/viterex-badge.module.css`). Other badge panels (Redaxo + ViteRex version labels, stage indicator, Vite-running dot, clear-cache button) and any `VITEREX_BADGE` extension-point panels (e.g. `redaxo-massif`'s Tailwind breakpoint indicator) are unaffected. The `data-git-branch` attribute on the script tag remains present for future use (e.g. a tooltip).

## **Version 3.2.1**

### Fixed

- **`REX_VITE` replacement scoped to `<head>`** (`lib/OutputFilter.php`). Previously `OutputFilter::rewriteHtml` replaced every `REX_VITE` occurrence anywhere in the rendered HTML, including literal mentions inside `<code>` / `<pre>` blocks on documentation pages that themselves describe how to use `viterex_addon`. The filter now finds the first `<head>...</head>` block and replaces only the first `REX_VITE` (or `REX_VITE[src="…"]`) inside it; subsequent placeholders and any `REX_VITE` text in `<body>` are left as literal text. Auto-insert before `</head>` is unchanged.

### Notes for upgraders

- If you (unusually) had multiple `REX_VITE` placeholders inside `<head>` to load different entries, only the first is now replaced. Combine them via the pipe-separated form: `REX_VITE[src="src/main.css|src/main.js"]`.

### Internal

- **PHPUnit added** as `require-dev` (`phpunit/phpunit ^10.5`). `tests/OutputFilterTest.php` covers the head-only scoping, body-untouched behavior, multiple-in-head, auto-insert, and missing-`<head>` edge cases. Run via `composer test`. Test infrastructure (`tests/`, `phpunit.xml.dist`, `.phpunit.cache`) is excluded from the release zip via `package.yml` `installer_ignore` and the publish workflow.
- For testability, the pure transformation in `OutputFilter` is split into a thin public `rewriteHtml()` shim that delegates to a new `@internal rewriteHtmlWithBlock(string, callable)` method. Public API and behavior at all callers (frontend `OUTPUT_FILTER`, `BLOCK_PEEK_OUTPUT`) are unchanged.

## **Version 3.2.0**

### Added

- **`viterex:install-stubs` Symfony Console command** (`lib/Console/InstallStubsCommand.php`, registered via `console_commands:` in `package.yml`). Programmatic counterpart of the *AddOns → ViteRex → Settings → Install stubs* button — reuses the same `Ynamite\ViteRex\StubsInstaller::run()` path, so output, backups, and `VITEREX_INSTALL_STUBS` extension-point dispatch are identical. Intended for automated install flows that scaffold a project without a browser session (e.g. `create-viterex`). Default behaviour skips existing files; pass `--overwrite` to back them up (`.bak.<timestamp>`) and replace. Print `-v` for the list of written paths.

  ```bash
  php bin/console viterex:install-stubs            # write only missing files
  php bin/console viterex:install-stubs --overwrite # backup + replace existing
  ```

## **Version 3.1.3**

### Fixed

- Restored `rex_developer_manager::setBasePath(rex_path::src())` in `boot.php` when the `developer` addon is available. The call was dropped during the v3 refactor (commit `137f8ea`) along with the now-removed `Structure` class; without it, the developer addon writes to its default location instead of the Redaxo source directory.

## **Version 3.1.2**

- Path-naming consistency pass. No behavior changes beyond the rename. **Migration**: existing 3.0.x / 3.1.0 / 3.1.1 installs have their `structure.json` at `var/data/addons/viterex/` (or `redaxo/data/addons/viterex/`) and reference `assets/addons/viterex/viterex-vite-plugin.js` in their `vite.config.js`. After upgrading, re-save the Settings form to seed the new path, and update the `viterex-vite-plugin.js` import in `vite.config.js` from `…/viterex/…` to `…/viterex_addon/…` (or click "Install stubs" with overwrite to have the import re-baked).
- add exclude to gitignore example for the new `assets/addons/viterex_addon/` path.

### Changed

- **Addon-name normalization across all paths**: `viterex` → `viterex_addon` (matches `package.yml`'s `package:` key, which is what Redaxo's package manager actually uses on disk). Touches:
  - `assets/viterex-vite-plugin.js` — `STRUCTURE_PATH_CANDIDATES` now points at `var/data/addons/viterex_addon/structure.json` and `redaxo/data/addons/viterex_addon/structure.json`; error message updated.
  - `lib/StubsInstaller.php::resolvePluginImportPath()` — `__VITEREX_PLUGIN_IMPORT_PATH__` token is now baked as `./<public>/assets/addons/viterex_addon/viterex-vite-plugin.js` in the scaffolded `vite.config.js`.
  - `stubs/biome.jsonc` — Biome include glob updated to `**/assets/addons/viterex_addon/**/*.*`.
  - `stubs/.env.example`, `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md` — references aligned.

## **Version 3.1.1**

### Fixed

- **HTTPS dev-server checkbox** in _AddOns → ViteRex → Settings_ didn't actually enable HTTPS. `rex_form_checkbox_element` saves checked options as pipe-delimited strings (`|1|`), but `Config::syncStructureJson()` compared `=== '1'` and so always wrote `"https_enabled": false` to `structure.json`. The Vite plugin then started in plain HTTP and the hot file ended up `http://127.0.0.1:5173`. New `isCheckboxChecked()` helper in `lib/Config.php` strips outer pipes, splits on `|`, and tests for `'1'` membership — round-trips correctly across all five values the field can take (`|1|`, `||`, `''`, `'0'`, `'1'`).

## **Version 3.1.0**

Programmatic API additions for downstream addons (e.g. redaxo-massif). No breaking changes.

### Added

- **`StubsInstaller::installFromDir($sourceDir, $stubsMap, $overwrite, $packageDeps)`** — public, reusable file-installer. Downstream addons call it from their own `install.php` / Settings handlers to push files into the user's project, reusing viterex_addon's path-baking, backup-on-overwrite, and structure-aware target resolution.
- **`StubsInstaller::appendRefreshGlobs($lines)`** — public helper for downstream addons that need Vite to live-reload on additional paths (e.g. their own fragments/lib directories). Reads `rex_config('viterex','refresh_globs')`, idempotently appends only missing lines.
- **`VITEREX_INSTALL_STUBS` extension point** — fired from inside `StubsInstaller::run()` (the path triggered by viterex's "Install Stubs" button). Subject is the result array `{written, skipped, backedUp, gitignoreAction}`. Subscribers can append entries by calling `installFromDir()` themselves and merging the returned arrays into the subject. Params: `overwrite` (bool, from the user's checkbox).
- **`mergePackageDeps()` private helper** — wired into `installFromDir` via the `$packageDeps` argument. Merges npm dependencies into the user's `package.json` additively, with `version_compare` resolving conflicts (higher wins).

### Internal

- `StubsInstaller::run()` refactored to delegate file copying to `installFromDir()`. Behavior preserved; `gitignoreAction` still set via the existing `mergeGitignore()` (now only run by `run()`, not the generic `installFromDir`).
- Hardcoded install-result message in `pages/settings.php` extracted to a `viterex_install_result` lang key (`lang/en_gb.lang`, `lang/de_de.lang`). Now uses `rex_i18n::rawMsg()` like the rest of the page.
- German translation polish in `lang/de_de.lang` — leftover English fragments translated (`Entry Points` → `Einstiegspunkte`, `Tooling` → `Werkzeuge`, `Web-served` → `Vom Webserver ausgeliefertes`, `Install stubs` → `Stubs installieren`, `JS-Entry` / `CSS-Entry` → `JS-Einstiegspunkt` / `CSS-Einstiegspunkt`, `Dev-Tooling-Configs` → `Dev-Tooling-Konfigurationen`).

### Documentation

- `README.md` rewritten in German with full feature coverage matching the English version (entry points, paths, dev settings, hot-file flow, `REX_VITE` placeholder, dev badge, downstream-addon API). Earlier in the cycle, the English README was also revised for installation paths and settings.
- `docs/vite-plus-evaluation.md` added — evaluation of a potential Vite+ migration. Recommendation: monitor, no migration today.
- Hero image `viterex.png` added at repo root.

## **Version 3.0.0**

Breaking release. ViteRex is now a standalone Redaxo addon installable in **any** Redaxo setup (classic / modern / theme), with a Laravel-vite-plugin-style architecture and a Redaxo backend CRUD form for configuration.

### Added

- **Backend CRUD form** at _AddOns → ViteRex → Settings_ (`pages/settings.php`) for all paths and dev settings — entries, public dir, out dir, URL prefix, source dir, static copy dirs, HTTPS, live-reload globs. Persisted via `rex_config('viterex', ...)` and mirrored to `var/data/addons/viterex/structure.json` (modern) or `redaxo/data/addons/viterex/structure.json` (classic+theme) for the Vite plugin to read.
- **"Install stubs" button** with optional "overwrite existing" checkbox — copies `package.json`, `vite.config.js`, `.env.example`, dev-tooling configs, and entry stubs to the project root. Bakes the structure-aware `viterex-vite-plugin.js` import path at scaffold time. Also performs `.gitignore` scan-and-merge.
- **`REX_VITE` placeholder** with optional `[src="a|b"]` attribute (pipe-separated entries). Auto-inserts before `</head>` when no placeholder is present.
- **`assets/viterex-vite-plugin.js`** — Laravel-style Vite plugin shipped in the addon's `assets/` (Redaxo auto-copies to `<frontend>/assets/addons/viterex/`). Exports default `viterex(options)` returning a Plugin[] (hot-file plugin, named `viterex` plugin with `config()` hook injecting build/server/css/resolve, `viteStaticCopy` sibling, `liveReload` sibling). Also exports `fixTailwindFullReload()` for the Tailwind 4 hotUpdate workaround. Single-bind exit handlers for `exit`/`SIGINT`/`SIGTERM`/`SIGHUP`.
- **`Assets::path/url/inline`** — PHP helpers for static-asset references in templates (background images, inline SVG, etc.).
- **`Tailwind 4` shipped by default**: `@tailwindcss/vite`, `@tailwindcss/forms`, `@tailwindcss/typography`, `tailwind-clamp` are all in the scaffolded `package.json`. Users who don't want Tailwind delete two lines from `vite.config.js`.
- **`vite-plugin-static-copy`** for static-asset mirroring — replaces `rollup-plugin-copy` (which had `writeBundle` timing issues under Vite 8 + rolldown).
- **`mkcert`** as devDependency + `npm run setup-https` script — one command for local HTTPS certs.
- **Hot-file detection** at `<base>/.vite-hot` (dotfile, project root, single source of truth across all structures). Optional HTTP probe fallback when `VITE_DEV_SERVER` is set in env.
- **Reliable live-reload trigger** via PHP extension-point handlers. `boot.php` registers callbacks on ~30 content-save EPs (`ART_*`, `CAT_*`, `SLICE_*`, `MEDIA_*`, `CLANG_*`, `TEMPLATE_*`, `MODULE_*`, `YFORM_DATA_*`) that `touch()` a single signal file `<base>/.vite-reload-trigger`. The Vite plugin watches that file via `vite-plugin-live-reload`. Fixes the previous default that watched `var/cache/addons/{structure,url}/**` — those dirs are written on lazy cache regeneration during normal frontend navigation, causing spurious reloads. **Migration**: existing v3 installs that had the old default in their `Live-reload globs` setting need to manually update via Settings (replace `var/cache/addons/...` with `.vite-reload-trigger`).
- **Badge enhancements**: stage indicator (`dev`/`staging`/`prod`), Vite-running indicator with click-to-copy URL, Clear-cache button (CSRF-protected), `VITEREX_BADGE` extension point for downstream addons.
- **`VITEREX_PRELOAD`** extension point for custom dev-mode preload tags (e.g. webfonts).
- **Full manifest import-graph walk** with cycle detection in `Preload` (previously only one level deep).
- **`lib/Config.php`** — single source of truth for paths; `get/set/all/syncStructureJson/getHotFilePath/getHostUrl`.
- **`lib/StubsInstaller.php`** — handles the Install Stubs button action (copy + path-baking + gitignore merge).

### Changed

- **Composer autoload** PSR-4 (`Ynamite\ViteRex\`); `lib/Badge/Badge.php` moved to `lib/Badge.php`.
- **`package.yml`** PHP requirement `>=7.3` → `>=8.1`. Adds `page` section with subpages (settings, docs) and `installer_ignore` list.
- **Addon `assets/` layout**: badge build artifacts under `assets/badge/`, the Vite plugin file at `assets/viterex-vite-plugin.js` (top level). Internal vite.config.js outDir is `../assets/badge` so `emptyOutDir: true` doesn't wipe the committed plugin file.
- **`rex_developer_manager::setBasePath`** call removed — was structure-specific and not generally applicable now that paths are user-configured.
- **Build paths configurable via Settings** — defaults are modern (`public/dist`); classic/theme users adjust via the form. No more runtime auto-detection magic.

### Removed

- **`Assets::get()`** — templates must use `REX_VITE` placeholders.
- **`Server::getAssetsUrl/getImg/getCss/getFont/getJs/getAssetsPath/setValue`** etc. — replaced by `Assets::url/path/inline`.
- **`lib/Structure.php`** — replaced by `lib/Config.php`. No more runtime classic/modern/theme auto-detection.
- **Dev-mode font autoprobe** in `Preload` — was MASSIF-specific (hardcoded `src/assets/fonts`). Use the `VITEREX_PRELOAD` extension point for custom preloads.
- **`stubs/vite/`** subfolder — the Vite plugin file is no longer scaffolded into the user project; it ships inside the addon and is auto-copied by Redaxo.
- **`rollup-plugin-copy`** — replaced by `vite-plugin-static-copy` (rolldown-safe).
